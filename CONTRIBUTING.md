1. Create firebase project

- by using "Add firebase to your web app, copy all configuration details"

- create `.env` from `.env.TEMPLATE` and fill in firebase config data

- go to authentication and enable `anonymous` sign in method

2. Create development Slack application

- you need to be a team admin to install vacation bot

- go to api.slack.com and create new application

- your application needs to have those scopes in `OAuth & Permissions`:

bot

commands

users.profile:write

admin

dnd:write

channels:read

channels:write

groups:read

groups:write

and your redirect url defined: http://yourdomain.com/api/auth (or https) Note: this url for testing can be your localhost as well.

- your app needs to have bot user created

- your app needs to have `interactive messages` endpoint configured: https://yourdomain.com/api/im ( I recommend heroku.com ) Note: this url needs to publicly accessible https endpoint.

- your can now copy all slack configuration data from:

`Basic information`:

slack_app_client_id=xxx

slack_app_client_secret=xxx

`OAuth & Permissions`:

slack_api_token=xxx

slack_bot_token=xxx

slack_app_redirect_uri=xxx

# Heroku

I do recommend using Heroku for local and server side development. It is very easy to deploy and setup on both environments and it's free. It provides https endpoints by default as well.

Install heroku CLI on your local machine to use `heroku local` functionalities.

Some of the functionalities of the application you will be able to test without deploying to public server, like:

<<<<<<< HEAD
- bot websockets RTM connection, slack web API connection, hosting add to slack button and others

You will not be able to host public endpoints which are needed for two actions:

- authorizing application for installing to slack team

- interactive messages request handling

For those I recommend deploying to Heroku but you can also use other services and tunneling for local environment, such as localtunnel or ngrok ( the connection will be dependent on your internet)
